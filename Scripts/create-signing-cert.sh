#!/bin/bash
# Creates a local self-signed code-signing certificate in the login keychain.
#
# Why this exists: an ad-hoc signature (`codesign --sign -`) carries no identity at all,
# so the only thing macOS can pin a TCC permission to is the hash of the binary —
# `designated => cdhash H"…"`. Every rebuild changes that hash, the grant stops matching,
# and the stale row has to be deleted from Privacy settings by hand.
#
# With a certificate the requirement becomes
# `identifier "com.deskpins.mac" and certificate leaf = H"…"`, which survives rebuilds,
# so Accessibility and Screen Recording are granted once and stay granted.
#
# The certificate is only ever used locally. It is not trusted by the system and does not
# need to be — codesign accepts it as-is, and Gatekeeper is not involved for an app you
# built yourself. To remove it: Keychain Access → login → find "DeskPins Local Signing".
